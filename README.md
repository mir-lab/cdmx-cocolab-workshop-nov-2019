## Dependencies
* [TouchDesigner099](https://www.derivative.ca/099/Downloads/)

## Recommended Tools
Having an external text editor is key to lots of work in Touch. I like VS Code these days, though Sublime is also a solid choice
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## Before the Workshop
Before we meet there are a few things to make sure you’ve got in place. Here’s a quick run down of the pieces to make sure are in order before the workshop.

**Required**
* Make sure you’ve updated to the most recent stable build of TouchDesigner 099
* Download and install python 3.5.1. There's a link above to make sure you have the right version of Python. This version matches the same version Touch uses and will make sure we don't have any major hiccups while we're working together.
* Download the github repo linked above. We’ll be working with some files that are already set-up so we don’t have to make everything from scratch so it will be important to have these elements in place.
* Make sure you have your laptop charger packed in your bag :)

**Suggested**
* Download and install a text editor - you don’t need this, but it will make a world of difference when working with lots of Python. Our recommendation is to install VS Code as it has a built in terminal. 
* Reflect on the projects you’ve worked on in the past, and bring some questions about the problems you’ve encountered.
* Think about the wobbles you've had when working with Python, and bring some questions for the group to discuss.
* Don’t forget your three button mouse ;)
